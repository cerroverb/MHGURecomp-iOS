# MHGU Recomp for iOS

A fork of [morerokk/MHGURecomp](https://github.com/morerokk/MHGURecomp) for iPad and iPhone. It renders at the screen's
real resolution and keeps the whole HUD visible on an iPad's 4:3 screen. New upstream releases are merged and built
automatically. Also works on iPhone.

No game data is included. You need your own dump of MHGU 1.4.0.

## Install

1. Get `MHGURecomp-iOS.<version>.ipa` from [Releases](https://github.com/cerroverb/MHGURecomp-iOS/releases).
2. Sideload it with a tool such as [iloader](https://github.com/nab138/iloader).
3. Start the app once, then put `exefs` and `romfs` in `MHGURecomp/data` with the Files app.

A controller is needed, since there are no touch controls. Plus + Minus opens the settings menu. Everything else works
as in [upstream's README](https://github.com/morerokk/MHGURecomp#readme).
